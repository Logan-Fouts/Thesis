# Layered Architecture for Efficient and Accurate Detection of Semantic Near-Duplicate Images

## Introduction

The uncontrollable growth in the creation of photographs is and continues to be a problem requiring ways of efficient and accurate detection/management, particularly for semantically similar images. There exists techniques to accomplish this; however, these tend to be inefficient in varied datasets, less accurate, or are complicated. Thus, we propose a new approach using a layered architecture, built by leveraging different techniques together. Therefore, we plan on experimenting using standard image data sets in controlled experiments and then comparing them with other methods in terms of accuracy, efficiency, adaptability, and other key metrics.
