# Multi-Method NDI Detection Using a Layered Architecture Framework for Optimized Simplicity and Flexibility  

Welcome to the GitHub repository for me and Henry Pap's Bachelor's Thesis on Near-Duplicate Image Detection at Linnaeus University. This repo contains all resources, code, and documentation developed during the process. The thesis focuses on designing a flexible and simple architecture to improve the accessibility and adaptability of multi-method near-duplicate image detection algorithms/systems across varied datasets.

## Repository Structure

- **Code/**: Contains all the source code developed for the thesis.
- **Research/**: All articles and general research done for the thesis.
- **Writing/**: All separate parts of the final thesis document in mark down.
