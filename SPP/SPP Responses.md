## Preliminary Title
Improving visually duplicate image detection with deep learning and multimodal fusion
## Elevator Pitch
Background: Current image analysis often struggles to accurately identify near duplicate images due to the complexity and variability of real-world scenes, and the inheret complexity in defining what is a near duplicate. This shortcoming results in inadequate solutions for detecting copyright infringements and other legal concerns, as well as leading to unnecessary consumption of significant storage resources.

Challenge: Accurately extracting and utilizing low-level features from the main objects in images for more accurate duplicate detection remains relatively unexplored.

Action: Implement a program that will identifies main objects, classifies them, and extracts low-level features to generate a unique hash for each object that can then be used to decide if images are to be considered duplicates or not.

Evaluation: The effectiveness of the approach will be assessed by comparing the accuracy of this duplicate detection method against existing benchmarks and other strategies.
