This comes at no surprise, complex problem requires complex solutions, but what  
if it doesn’t have to always be this way. What if an approach was taken where current  
solutions are combined to not only reap benefits from each, but to see if the whole is  
greater than the sum of its parts. Occam’s Razor, a philosophical principle suggesting that the simplest explanation is often the correct one, is quite applicable to our  
situation. By utilizing a framework, based on a layered architecture, we hope  
to combine different near duplicate image detection algorithms and see if there can  
be some benefit. This allows for easy setup of image processing systems and exhaustive testing can be done quickly to give a combination that suites the use case.

From reading the abstract the reader should clearly understand what the report  
is all about. The purpose of the abstract is to make the reader interested in continue  
reading the report, if it covers something that the reader wants to know more about.
